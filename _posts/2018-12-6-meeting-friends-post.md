## reuniting

 When I can to america I did not know many things or people so I was scared of every body I had to talk to. It was scaery but then I reunited with so freind that I knew back in thailand and I felt better because I acutely knew them. I was so happy when I got back with the old freinds the I haven't seen in a while.

## meeting new friends

 I started school in first grade and it was close to the end of school year. When I first started I was shy and afrad to talk to people mostly because I did not know any english at all so I couldn't say the things I wanted to say. I meat some nice freinds that helped me out with stuff like writing and math and other stuff like that so I felt very welcomed. Even though I had freinds to help me out and I knew that most people were freindly, I still was shy to talk to people. over time I overcame that shyness little by little and it got easier to talk to people I don't know.
