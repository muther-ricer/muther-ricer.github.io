![travel](/images/travel.jpeg)

I came to america at the year 2010 and I was around 5 or 6 years old. Moving to america was a big change for my and my family because we did not know much english. We had a hard time talking to people as expected, but we had some friends that came before us and they helped us get a place to live and a job for my parents. We were able to live peaceful and normal lives. when my brothers started to go to school I felt so lonely because i was that little that was attached has siblings. I remember when I would always follow them around but I couldn't anymore because of school. I finally got into school and I started in 1st grade and i did not know much, I have a very hard time talking and was always a shy kid.
